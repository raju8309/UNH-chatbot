These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program.

Students are not eligible to receive credit for any more than the maximum number of thesis credits required by the degree and are expected to monitor their registration to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum. No thesis credit shall be given until the completed thesis has been approved by the thesis committee and accepted by the Graduate School. Satisfactory acceptance of the thesis will be recorded with a grade of (CR)."}]}
