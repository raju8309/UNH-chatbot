Qualified senior students at the University of New Hampshire may be admitted to an approved accelerated graduate program in the Graduate School provided they have followed normal application procedures; they must have been admitted for the semester in which they wish to enroll in courses for dual credit. A 3.20 cumulative grade point average is normally required to be considered for the program. Students are normally admitted prior to the start of their senior year. Students who have been admitted to the program may register for a maximum of 12 credits of 800-­level courses prior to completing their bachelor's degree. Such courses may, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, count toward both the bachelor's and master's degrees. Up to 8 credits, upon recommendation of the department and approval of the Graduate School, may count towards both the bachelor's degree and a graduate certificate. For more information and a list of eligible programs, visit: https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/accelerated-masters-program . Consecutive Master's Degrees. Enrollment in consecutive master's degrees refers to admission and matriculation in a second master's degree program at the University of New Hampshire after the completion of the requirements for a first master's degree earned at the University of New Hampshire. A student may apply up to 12 credits earned in the first master's degree awarded at the University of New Hampshire toward a second master's degree with approval of the student's graduate advisory committee and/or graduate program coordinator in the second master's program. Thesis or research credits from the first program may not be counted toward the requirements of the second program. Concurrent Dual Degrees. Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously. A student may pursue concurrent degrees only with approval of the appropriate graduate program coordinator(s) and the dean of the Graduate School. With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately. Integrated dual degree programs must be approved by the Graduate Council and the dean of the Graduate School. Cotutelle Ph.D. Agreements with International Universities.

All students, including F-1 and J-1, may supplement their regular appointments for up to 20 hours per week when school is not in session (December-January Semester Break and March Spring Break). Such appointments may be processed as stipends or hourly. Assistants who serve as TA’s during the J-term receive a supplemental appointment if the workload exceeds the 20 hours they are normally expected to work."}], "transformed_query": "Where can I find information about assistantships?"}

This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course.

This provides you with important industry-relevant transferrable job skills, such as clear communication, cooperation and relationship building, teamwork and conflict resolution, and creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. These transferrable skills are developed hand-in-hand with the wet-lab skills. In addition to the core lab and lecture coursework covering the major industry areas of cell, molecular, and protein biochemistry, the program incorporates a core course entitled “Biotechnology Products and Regulation.” This course takes a critical look at industry from the initial stages of research and development in the biomedical sciences through the legal and regulatory stages of biotechnology product development and manufacturing. This content is key to understanding how the biotech industry functions and thus is a centerpiece in your training in our degree program. Finally, you are required to enroll in a minimum of one graduate biotech seminar course. While the specific content of the seminar courses will vary to reflect the dynamics of the ever-changing biotech field, the two typical focus areas of the semester-long seminars will be “Instrumentation in the Biotech Industry” and “Cutting edge topics in the Biotech Industry today”. Elective Courses In addition to the Core requirements, you will develop a curriculum plan with your Faculty Advisor that includes elective courses. This curriculum plan will be customized to meet your career goals. While most students will likely choose elective courses offered in the Department of Life Sciences at UNH Manchester, the program welcomes you to enroll in courses in other UNH colleges in order to complete your elective requirements. In some cases (and with the recommendation of the Faculty Advisor and approval of the Graduate Program Coordinator), courses not on the approved electives list may be incorporated into the curriculum plan."}, {"rank": 5, "idx": 8835, "score": 0.694862, "title": "Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology (M.S.) - Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology (M.S.) - All MCBS graduates will be able to:", "url": "https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/programs-study/molecular-cellular-biomedical-sciences/molecular-cellular-biotechnology-ms/", "tier": 4, "tier_name": "program", "text": "Molecular and Cellular Biotechnology (M.S.) - All MCBS graduates will be able to:\n\nFollow the principles of ethics in their field, and in academia.

Enrollment in concurrent dual degrees occurs when a student is admitted to and matriculated in two graduate degree programs at the University of New Hampshire simultaneously.

With approval of the student's graduate advisory committee(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator(s), a student may apply up to 12 UNH credits earned in one master's degree toward the requirements for a second master's degree. A student must complete the capstone requirements for both programs. Completion of degree requirements for the two programs need not be at the same time. Integrated Dual Degrees. Integrated dual degrees occurs when two graduate programs have formalized a program of study which creates an integrated program linking the two disciplines, while continuing toward separate degrees. Students must be admitted to both programs and complete the requirements for both degrees. Integrated dual degree programs may include a single admissions process, submission of a single thesis or capstone experience, and a single advisory committee composed of members from both programs. The number of required credit hours for integrated dual degrees must not be less than 80 percent of the total minimum hours required to complete each degree separately.
