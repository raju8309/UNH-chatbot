ANSWER:
Students are expected to file an Advancement to Candidacy form with the Graduate
School as soon as possible after all of the requirements for candidacy have been
met.

CONTEXT:
[1] Certificate Requirements: There are two separate tracks for this program. Track
1 is for students enrolled in the New Hampshire-Leadership Education in
Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (NH-LEND) training program. Track 2 is for all
other students. The program of study consists of two required courses (6 credit
hours), and two (2) electives (6 credit hours) or one (1) elective and one (1)
three(3)­credit hour independent study. Below is a detailed description of each
track.

[2] Final Defense: The final oral examination is conducted by the doctoral committee
and is intended to give the candidate an opportunity to defend the dissertation.
While it is desirable for all committee members to participate in dissertation
defenses, whether in person or through virtual means such as conference calls or
video conferencing, outside scholars are not required to be present at the
defense. Departments will determine how to obtain meaningful and substantive
evaluations from external members in consultation with the Graduate School. A
written final examination, on subject matter not covered in the qualifying
examination, may also be required. This written examination is conducted by the
major department. These final examinations must be completed by the date listed
in the Graduate School calendar. After consultation with the major program, the
dean of the Graduate School may appoint, for participation in the final oral
examination, additional members of the faculty under whom the student has
worked. The doctoral committee alone shall decide on the merits of the
candidate's performance by a majority vote.

[3] Non-thesis Option: Requirements for non-­thesis capstone experiences must be
clearly articulated by each program. Capstone experiences, with the exception of
capstone courses, must be approved by a committee of at least two faculty
members in the student's program and approved by the graduate program
coordinator. All capstone experiences must be completed by the end of the final
examination period of the graduation date for which the degree is to be
conferred.

[4] Ph.D. Candidacy: A Ph.D. student is advanced to candidacy for the degree by the
dean of the Graduate School upon recommendation of the graduate program
coordinator after the student has passed the qualifying examination, met the
language or proficiency requirements as are deemed desirable by the student's
program, declared a topic for dissertation research, and fully formed their
doctoral dissertation committee. * Students are expected to file an Advancement
to Candidacy form with the Graduate School as soon as possible after all of the
requirements for candidacy have been met.

[5] Doctoral Committee: When a Ph.D. student advances to candidacy, a doctoral
committee will be appointed to supervise and pass on the dissertation and
administer the final examination. This committee will be nominated by the
department of major concentration and appointed by the dean of the Graduate
School. It shall normally consist of a minimum of five members, usually three
from the major department and two from related departments. The dean of the
Graduate School is an ex-officio member of all doctoral committees.

quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[5] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military

and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[2] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,

missed.
