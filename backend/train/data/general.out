participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[3] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: A student who has been dismissed
for failure to make required academic progress may, with the permission of the
dean of the Graduate School, enroll as a non-degree student in courses in their

quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[5] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

QUESTION:
What's required for doctoral candidacy?

ANSWER:
A NSB PhD degree requires the completion of course work, passing a qualifying
exam, complete dissertation research, and generation of manuscripts that are
deemed of publishable quality by their Dissertation Committee. The final oral
examination is conducted by the major department and is intended to give the
candidate an opportunity to defend the dissertation. While it is desirable for
all committee members to participate in dissertation defenses, whether in person
or through virtual means such as conference calls or video conferencing, outside
scholars are not required to be present at the defense. Departments will
determine how to obtain meaningful and substantive evaluations from external
members in consultation

CONTEXT:
[1] Advancement to Candidacy: UNH requires that doctoral students advance to PhD
candidacy within 5 years. Successful completion of the Qualifying Exam (both the
written and oral portions) will result in advancement to PhD candidacy. The
Guidance Committee oversees the qualifying examination and is responsible for
approving the proposal after which the student is admitted to doctoral
candidacy.

[2] Qualifying Examination: The qualifying exam may be awarded a grade of Pass,
Conditional Pass, or No Pass. Upon passing the qualifying examination, the
student advances to PhD candidacy, officially declaring the intended
dissertation topic and appointing their Dissertation Committee. For students
receiving a Conditional Pass, specific weaknesses identified by the committee
must be addressed through additional coursework, revision, or research. Students
who receive a No Pass, indicating insufficient mastery of scientific premise,
lab skills, or critical thinking, have the option to retake the qualifying exam
within 6 months. Students who cannot pass the qualifying exam after a second
attempt are advised to pursue a Master’s degree, in which case they will need to
formally change programs to the NSB M.S.

[3] Doctoral Guidance and Dissertation Committees: Upon advancement to doctoral
candidacy, the Doctoral Dissertation Committee is established, and the
Dissertation Committee Nomination Form is submitted to the Graduate School. The
Dissertation Committee will have at least 5 members: no more than 3 from any one
NSB department, and 2 from other departments within UNH and/or from other
doctoral-granting institutions. The members of the committee, other than the
advisor (or co-advisors), should not be directly involved in the student’s
proposed research. Students are strongly encouraged to consider recruiting
committee members from beyond UNH to broaden their professional networks
(outside members are typically appointed to the committee as the doctoral
research progresses). The Dissertation Committee will supervise the
dissertation, administer the final examination (dissertation defense), and
determine that the work merits the award of a degree.

[4] Dissertation and Defense: The Dissertation Defense should occur by Year 5. The
Dissertation Committee will meet prior to the formal dissertation defense to
determine whether the project is ready to defend. Students must meet the
Graduate School’s requirements for a NSB PhD degree, which requires the
completion of course work, passing a qualifying exam, completion of dissertation
research, and generation of manuscripts that are deemed of publishable quality
by their Dissertation Committee. Although not a program requirement, PhD
students are encouraged to present their research in scientific conferences and
publish research article(s) in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

[5] Final Defense: The final oral examination is conducted by the doctoral committee
and is intended to give the candidate an opportunity to defend the dissertation.
While it is desirable for all committee members to participate in dissertation
defenses, whether in person or through virtual means such as conference calls or
video conferencing, outside scholars are not required to be present at the
defense. Departments will determine how to obtain meaningful and substantive
evaluations from external members in consultation with the Graduate School. A
written final examination, on subject matter not covered in the qualifying
examination, may also be required. This written examination is conducted by the
major department. These final examinations must be completed by the date listed
in the Graduate School calendar. After consultation with the major program, the
dean of the Graduate School may appoint, for participation in the final oral
examination, additional members of the faculty under whom the student has
worked. The doctoral committee alone shall decide on the merits of the
candidate's performance by a majority vote.

How many members are on the graduate council?

ANSWER:
The Graduate Council is comprised of 13 graduate faculty members and four
graduate students.

CONTEXT:
[1] Doctoral Committee: When a Ph.D. student advances to candidacy, a doctoral
committee will be appointed to supervise and pass on the dissertation and
administer the final examination. This committee will be nominated by the
department of major concentration and appointed by the dean of the Graduate
School. It shall normally consist of a minimum of five members, usually three
from the major department and two from related departments. The dean of the
Graduate School is an ex-officio member of all doctoral committees.

[2] Final Defense: The final oral examination is conducted by the doctoral committee
and is intended to give the candidate an opportunity to defend the dissertation.
While it is desirable for all committee members to participate in dissertation
defenses, whether in person or through virtual means such as conference calls or
video conferencing, outside scholars are not required to be present at the
defense. Departments will determine how to obtain meaningful and substantive
evaluations from external members in consultation with the Graduate School. A
written final examination, on subject matter not covered in the qualifying
examination, may also be required. This written examination is conducted by the
major department. These final examinations must be completed by the date listed
in the Graduate School calendar. After consultation with the major program, the
dean of the Graduate School may appoint, for participation in the final oral
examination, additional members of the faculty under whom the student has
worked. The doctoral committee alone shall decide on the merits of the
candidate's performance by a majority vote.

[3] Graduate Council: The Graduate Council is comprised of 13 graduate faculty
members and four graduate students. The council advises the dean of the Graduate
School on policies concerning graduate education and is responsible to the
graduate faculty for recommendations concerning new graduate programs and
curricular changes. Standing committees of the council include the doctoral
program committee, the master's program committee, the student affairs
committee, and program review committee.

a regular member of the graduate faculty under whose direction it was written
and two other members of the graduate faculty nominated by the department
chairperson or graduate program coordinator and appointed by the dean of the
Graduate School. Individuals who are not regular members of the graduate faculty
may be nominated to serve on committees in accordance with individual program
policies.

QUESTION:
Are there any restrictions on scheduling exams during election days?

ANSWER:
Students who are absent without excuse from an announced test, quiz,
examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the instructor, be
penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work missed.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: In order that UNH students may fully exercise their constitutional
right to vote in New Hampshire state and federal elections, no examinations will
be scheduled on the first Tuesday of November, and such should be designated in
the University calendars. Opportunities for makeup of other scheduled exercises
on those days should be provided where necessary. Faculty are requested to
cooperate to the fullest extent with students from communities scheduling
elections at other times.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[3] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[4] Ph.D. Candidacy: *Note: If the doctoral candidacy form is received before the
final day to register for the current semester, then candidacy shall be
effective immediately. If the form is received after the final day to register
for the current semester then candidacy shall be effective at the start of the
following semester. Candidacy will not be backdated.

[5] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.
