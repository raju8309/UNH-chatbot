QUESTION:
What graduate courses are available?

ANSWER:
Spanish (Graduate Certificate) - Program Courses (grad): The graduate course
offerings in Spanish are, with the exception of the two pedagogy courses ( SPAN
890 and LLC 891 ), always special topics classes. These classes are not
occasionally offered ‘extras’, but rather the core.

CONTEXT:
[1] Spanish (Graduate Certificate): Students applying for the Graduate Certificate
in Spanish must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution with a
minimum grade point average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale). If the B.A./B.S. degree did
not include a major or concentration in Spanish, students must have completed
advanced-level conversation, composition or advanced language course(s), or
equivalent. Study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country is highly recommended.
Degree and course equivalency is determined on a case-by-case basis, in
consultation with the Graduate Coordinator (who serves as the administrator for
the Certificate Program).

[2] Program Requirements: Completion of the graduate certificate requires five
three-credit courses in Spanish, organized in logical manner to provide
knowledge and expertise relevant to a specific aspect of professional and/or

QUESTION:
What happens if I miss too many classes?

ANSWER:
Students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may
also request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. In these cases, faculty have discretion
regarding what flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students
may contact the Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating
circumstance that will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request
that ...

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty may excuse student absences include: (a) ill
health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[3] Academic Standards: Graduate students receiving grades below "B-­" in 9 or more
credits , including undergraduate courses taken while a graduate student, will
be dismissed from the Graduate School. 1

[4] Academic Standards: Each individual program may set and announce standards for
coursework, examinations, and/or research achievement that are more rigorous
than the Graduate School standard. Thus, students may be dismissed if they
accumulate fewer than 9 credits below the "B­-" level, and/or fail to make
adequate progress in other aspects of their graduate program.

[5] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.
