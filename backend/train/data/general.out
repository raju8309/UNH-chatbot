expertise relevant to a specific aspect of professional and/or personal
development. All coursework in a certificate program must be taken at UNH.
Courses may be applied to only one certificate program but may also be applied
to a master’s or doctoral degree program at UNH. There are no upper limits to
the number of credits that may be applied to a degree program provided the

addition, the Graduate School oversees intercollegiate programs that involve
faculty and coursework from more than one school or college. Intercollegiate
programs offer students the opportunity to pursue new and emerging fields of
study that draw upon multiple disciplines, leading to solid disciplinary
foundations as well as cross­-disciplinary skills useful for solving new social
and scientific problems. Opportunities for interdisciplinary research are also
available in the institutes and centers at the University.

QUESTION:
Can graduate and undergraduate students take the same course together?

ANSWER:
Graduates receiving grades below "B--" in 9 or more credits , including
undergraduate courses taken while a graduate student, will be dismissed from the
Graduate School.

CONTEXT:
[1] Simultaneous 700/800 Courses: Section: Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses -
Simultaneous 700/800 Courses

[2] 800-­level courses may be cross-­listed with 700-­level courses and taught
simultaneously to both graduate and undergraduate students. While the content of
the course is the same, the requirements and expectations of the students differ
substantially with assignments, examinations, and projects demonstrating a
broader depth of understanding, sophistication and skills for students enrolled
at the 800 ­level. The method of assessing graduate student demonstration of a
higher level of understanding and skill is made clear to students on course
syllabi. Students must be enrolled in the 800 level of the course in order to
obtain graduate credit.

[3] 700 Level Courses: Section: Graduate Courses - Graduate Courses - 700 Level
Courses

[4] 700-level courses are advanced undergraduate courses. In rare cases graduate
degree students may petition to earn graduate credit for up to 12 credits in
700-­level courses, provided the credits are taken in a program other than the
one in which the student is seeking the degree and provided such courses are
approved by the student's adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the dean of
the Graduate School. Such courses must be taken for a letter grade. Petitions
must include what additional requirements or expectations will be required of
the student to make the course a graduate level experience. Petition requests
must be made prior to enrolling in the course and are not guaranteed. Petition
forms are available at https://gradschool.unh.edu/academics/forms-policies .

[5] Academic Standards: Graduate students receiving grades below "B-­" in 9 or more
credits , including undergraduate courses taken while a graduate student, will
be dismissed from the Graduate School. 1 Graduate students enrolled under the
accelerated master's program receiving any grade below "B-­" in a graduate
course while in dual status may be dismissed and have their admission to the
Graduate School withdrawn. Graduate students will have a maximum of two
opportunities to successfully complete final examinations for the master's or

credits while completing a bachelor’s degree. Students complete the bachelor’s
degree, and then officially matriculate into the master’s or graduate
certificate program to complete the remaining required graduate-level
coursework.

[6] Students enrolled in the Master in Public Policy and Juris Doctor (MPP/JD) Dual
Degree program are required to earn a minimum of 104 credits to successfully
complete the dual degree which confers both an MPP degree and a JD degree. If
both degrees are pursued separately, students are required to take a total of

With the MPP/JD Dual Degree, the UNH Franklin Pierce Law School accepts up to 12
credits of approved MPP courses and the Carsey School of Public Policy accepts
up to 9 credits of approved JD courses, reducing the total required credits to
104 and time to complete the two degrees to three and one half years, a savings
of one year. It is highly recommended that students meet with their Graduate
Academic Advisors from both programs prior to starting their Dual Degree to
insure they have a clear understanding of each program's prerequisites, degree
requirements, course schedules, and to determine the best time to take their MPP
coursework. Students are required to start their first year of the MPP/JD Dual
Degree program in the fall at the UNH Franklin Pierce Law School and complete at
least one year of their Juris Doctor curriculum ( Juris Doctor: Residential
(J.D.) Program or Juris Doctor: Daniel Webster Scholar Honors (J.D.) Program )
prior to starting their MPP program. Students complete their year of MPP
coursework at the Carsey School of Public Policy in their second or third year
of the MPP/JD Dual Degree program with guidance from their JD Academic Advisor.
Students are advised to have taken an introductory level economics class prior
to starting their MPP program such as a “principles of economics” course (macro
or micro).

[4] Candidacy: Following approval of the research proposal and completion of
coursework, doctoral students should advance to candidacy. Candidacy is reached
after passing a formal qualifying examination that assesses both broad basic
knowledge of the student’s field, and topics central to the research project.
The purpose of the exam is to measure of the student’s likelihood of
successfully completing a doctoral program. The qualifying exam comprises
written and oral components. When the student has passed both parts of the
qualifying exam, the advisor will inform the Graduate School and recommend that
the student be advanced to candidacy in the Ph.D. degree program. Dissertation
and Oral Defense: All students must complete a dissertation reporting original
research. After completion of the research, the candidate must provide a copy of
the dissertation to the Doctoral Dissertation committee at least two weeks prior
to the final oral examination. The final thesis defense consists of two parts:
an oral presentation of the research in a public seminar, and an oral defense of
the dissertation conducted by the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. Final
approval of the dissertation will be determined by a majority vote of the
committee.
