QUESTION:
What is the grading system for graduate courses?

ANSWER:
Graduate credit is only granted for courses completed with a grade of B-­ or
higher. Individual programs may have stricter requirements, and those are
published with their degree program requirements.

CONTEXT:
[1] [1] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Letter grades: The following grades are used at the University: A (4.0), A-­

(1.33), D (1.0), D-­ (.67), F (0). Graduate credit is only granted for courses
completed with a grade of B-­ or higher. Individual programs may have stricter
requirements, and those are published with their degree program requirements. AF
Grades: An "AF" grade, Administrative F, is assigned for failure to either drop
or complete a course. An "AF" is considered the same as an "F."

[3] [2] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[4] Credit/Fail Grades: Given in specific courses having no letter grades, such as
thesis/dissertation, as well as other approved courses or seminars. A "CR" grade
is assigned for successful completion, while an "F" is assigned for failure.
Pass/Fail Grades: Graduate courses cannot be taken pass/fail. A graduate student
may petition to take undergraduate courses on a pass/fail basis. Such a petition
must be approved by the end of the add period for the term the course is taken.
Courses at the 700-­level approved for graduate credit cannot be taken for
pass/fail.

[8] Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared to discuss and explain the basis for
their evaluation of students. If, after consulting the instructor, a student
still believes that he or she was treated unfairly, he or she has the right to
seek redress from the chairperson of the department or program in which the
course is offered. Under exceptional circumstances, a final appeal may be made
to the dean of the college or school in which the program is offered. Repeated
courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course or grade from
the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate
students must obtain written permission of their adviser, graduate program
coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean before the
adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in the
cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.

[14] Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the instructor
for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and submitted to
the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not later than
the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one in which
the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester
deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary
circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be submitted. The
petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be approved by the
instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being
submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be granted by the dean only
under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from
the end of the semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete
grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not
approved within the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students
who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA
Grades: "IA" indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or
other continuing courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will
replace the "IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral
research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript.

requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence.

QUESTION:
What happens if I get an incomplete grade?

ANSWER:
An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or a petition for an
extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This policy also
applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved
leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] [1] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[2] Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the instructor
for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and submitted to
the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not later than
the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one in which
the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester
deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary
circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be submitted. The
petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be approved by the
instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being
submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be granted by the dean only
under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from
the end of the semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete
grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not
approved within the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students
who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved leave of absence. IA
Grades: "IA" indicates "incomplete" in thesis credit, doctoral research, or
other continuing courses of more than one semester. The grade earned will
replace the "IA" once the work has been completed. In the case of doctoral
research, once the dissertation is deemed complete, only the final term of
enrollment will be assigned a "CR". Prior semester "IA" grades will remain on
the official transcript.

[3] [2] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[4] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,

[6] Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared to discuss and explain the basis for
their evaluation of students. If, after consulting the instructor, a student
still believes that he or she was treated unfairly, he or she has the right to
seek redress from the chairperson of the department or program in which the
course is offered. Under exceptional circumstances, a final appeal may be made
to the dean of the college or school in which the program is offered. Repeated
courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course or grade from
the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match exactly, graduate
students must obtain written permission of their adviser, graduate program
coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean before the
adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in the
cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[7] [4] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[8] NR Grades: "NR" indicates "Not Resolved: pending academic integrity allegation".
W Grades: If a student, for compelling nonacademic reasons, submits an approved
petition to drop a course during the withdrawal period, a notation of "W" will
be shown on the student's academic record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can
be found on the UNH Academic Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will
result in an AF grade, which is maintained on the official student record and
included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does not
constitute an automatic withdrawal.

[9] [5] Attendance: Attendance

[10] Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty assess
absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor based
on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are described
in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty regarding any
circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay home and/or
which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities and
expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively ask
faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as related
to their absences or in general. Reasons that faculty may excuse student
absences include: (a) ill health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c)
instructional trips, and (d) when students are representing UNH in regional,
national, and international academic-related opportunities. In these cases,
faculty have discretion regarding what flexibility to offer based on their
syllabus policies. Students may contact the Dean of Students if they’re managing
a temporary, extenuating circumstance that will affect their academics for an
ongoing period to request that a notice be sent to their faculty. These notices
will not be sent in situations where students are missing only one or two days
of class.

that students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. Faculty
may still set expectations regarding how students make up missed work and learn
missed content. Faculty may also request documentation regarding official
intercollegiate events, required military service, and jury duty. If a student
is called for required military service or jury duty that will cause them to
miss class for an extended period and render them unable to adequately fulfill
the standards and requirements of the course as determined by the instructor,
that student should contact the associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss
options to drop or withdraw.

QUESTION:
What's the difference between an M.S. and M.A. degree?

ANSWER:
The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-level courses (9-12 graduate
credits) be in an area of subject matter concentration rather than in education.
Students who have previously completed a baccalaureate degree at UNH or another
institution may also apply to the teacher preparation program at the graduate
level.

QUESTION:
What happens if I need to take a leave of absence from my graduate program?

ANSWER:
Students who, because of extenuating circumstances, are unable to pursue their
graduate program may request a leave of absence. Such circumstances may include
medical reasons, military obligation, family emergencies, or hardship.

CONTEXT:
[1] Leave of Absence: Students who, because of extenuating circumstances, are unable
to pursue their graduate program may request a leave of absence for a maximum of
one calendar year. Such circumstances may include medical reasons, military
obligation, family emergencies, or hardship. The procedure for an approved leave
of absence requires that students submit a request, available at the Graduate
School's website, along with appropriate documentation, prior to the term for
which the leave is requested. The dean of the Graduate School, upon
recommendation of the student's adviser and graduate program coordinator, will
review the request. If the request for a leave is granted, the time limit for
completion of the student's program will be extended appropriately. Students on
an approved leave of absence are exempt from paying the continuing enrollment
fee. Graduate students who do not return from a leave of absence in the allotted
time frame will have their degree status discontinued.

[2] Degree Status Discontinued: Students who do not formally withdraw and do not
register and pay for course credits, research, or continuing enrollment by the
appropriate registration deadline, or do not return from an approved leave of
absence, will have their degree status discontinued. Students are notified by
the Graduate School when this administrative action is taken and are required to
apply for readmission or reinstatement if they subsequently desire to resume
their academic program.

[3] Continuous Registration Policy: Unless a leave of absence is granted, graduate
students enrolled in face to face programs are required to maintain continuous
enrollment each semester of the academic year until their degree is formally
awarded by registering for course credits, research, or continuing enrollment.
Students who do not maintain continuous enrollment as required will have their
degree status discontinued and will no longer be active in the degree. Students
will need to petition for reinstatement or readmission in order to return to
their program.

[4] Master's Time Limit: All graduate work for any master's degree must normally be
completed within four years from the date of matriculation (enrollment following
admission) in the program. Progress toward the degree will be carefully
monitored by the advisor and the Graduate School to ensure that adequate
advancement is made toward the completion of the program and that any
deficiencies noted at the time of admission are removed. Students failing to
make adequate advancement toward completion of the program are subject to
dismissal in advance of the four-year time limit. Extensions to the four-year
time limit will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Years on leave do not
count toward the time limit.

[5] Withdrawal: A student may request to fully withdraw from their graduate degree
program during any semester by obtaining a withdrawal form from the Graduate
School website. Students who formally withdraw are required to apply for
readmission if they subsequently desire to resume their academic program.
Students who are applying for readmission are required to pay an application fee
plus, if readmitted, any accumulated continuing enrollment fees for the period
during which they have been inactive. Students are not guaranteed readmission
and may be evaluated in competition with current applicants to the program.

[10] W Grades: If a student, for compelling nonacademic reasons, submits an approved
petition to drop a course during the withdrawal period, a notation of "W" will
be shown on the student's academic record. The specific withdrawal deadlines can
be found on the UNH Academic Calendar. Failure to officially withdraw will
result in an AF grade, which is maintained on the official student record and
included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does not
constitute an automatic withdrawal. Appeals: Every instructor must be prepared
to discuss and explain the basis for their evaluation of students. If, after
consulting the instructor, a student still believes that he or she was treated
unfairly, he or she has the right to seek redress from the chairperson of the
department or program in which the course is offered. Under exceptional
circumstances, a final appeal may be made to the dean of the college or school
in which the program is offered.

[11] [6] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[12] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence.

[13] [7] Attendance: Attendance

[14] Excused absences Specific attendance requirements including how individual
faculty assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course
instructor based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance
policies are described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their
faculty regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them
to stay home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course
activities and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and
proactively ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the
course, as related to their absences or in general.

graduate degrees, be transferred to count toward their graduate program. Courses
must be at the graduate level and cannot have been used or be in the process of
being used in earning another graduate degree or certificate or have been taken
while completing a bachelor's degree. A grade of B or better must have been
earned. Students must submit an External Transfer Credit Form to request that
the credits be applied to their degree requirements. The transfer credit request
must be recommended by the program faculty and approved by the Graduate School.
Current UNH graduate students who wish to take a course at another university,
with the intention of transferring, should obtain the approval of their advisor
and graduate school prior to enrolling in the course to ensure that the course
meets the transfer requirements.

opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class. Reasons that faculty must
excuse student absences are: (a) participation in official intercollegiate
events, (b) participation in official adaptive sports events facilitated by
Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d) required military service, and (e)
important religious holidays and/or observances. In these cases, it is expected
that students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. Faculty
may still set expectations regarding how students make up missed work and learn
missed content. Faculty may also request documentation regarding official
intercollegiate events, required military service, and jury duty. If a student
is called for required military service or jury duty that will cause them to
miss class for an extended period and render them unable to adequately fulfill
the standards and requirements of the course as determined by the instructor,
that student should contact the associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss
options to drop or withdraw.

[9] [5] Attendance: Attendance

[10] Absence on voting day In order that UNH students may fully exercise their
constitutional right to vote in New Hampshire state and federal elections, no
examinations will be scheduled on the first Tuesday of November, and such should
be designated in the University calendars. Opportunities for makeup of other
scheduled exercises on those days should be provided where necessary. Faculty
are requested to cooperate to the fullest extent with students from communities
scheduling elections at other times.

[11] [6] Grades: Graduate Grading - Grades

[12] Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for which an
audit was granted. No credit is earned. Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is
assigned with the approval of the instructor for excused unfinished work only.
The work must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the date agreed
upon with the instructor, but not later than the last day of classes of the
semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted
(800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-,
and 700-­level courses). If extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition
requesting additional time may be submitted. The petition, listing a specific
deadline for completion, must be approved by the instructor, the student's
adviser, and graduate program coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate
School. An extension will be granted by the dean only under unusual
circumstances and will usually not exceed one calendar year from the end of the
semester in which the course was originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes
an "F" if not resolved or if a petition for an extension is not approved within
the allotted time period. This policy also applies to students who withdraw from
the University or who are on an approved leave of absence.
