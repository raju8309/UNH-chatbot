coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed

before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point

ANSWER:
The University of New Hampshire is the largest university in the U.S. that
offers graduate ­level courses and final examinations during the summer session.

CONTEXT:
[1] Submission of Thesis: The final approved thesis must be submitted for
publication by ProQuest via the UNH ETD Administrator website by the appropriate
deadline as published in the Graduate School calendar. Physical hard bound
copies are available for purchase through ProQuest at the time of submission.
Students may choose to copyright their thesis at the time of publication. All
fees are to be paid by the student at the time of submission.

[2] Submission of Dissertation: The final approved dissertation must be submitted
for publication by ProQuest via the UNH ETD Administrator website by the
appropriate deadline as published in the Graduate School calendar. Physical hard
bound copies are available for purchase through ProQuest at the time of
submission. Students may choose to copyright their thesis at the time of
publication. All fees are to be paid by the student at the time of submission.
If the dissertation material is further published, it should be designated as
having been accepted as a doctoral dissertation by the University of New
Hampshire.

[3] Appeals Process: Amended with approval by the Graduate Council November 3 rd ,
2017

[4] Final Defense: The final oral examination is conducted by the doctoral committee
and is intended to give the candidate an opportunity to defend the dissertation.
While it is desirable for all committee members to participate in dissertation
defenses, whether in person or through virtual means such as conference calls or
video conferencing, outside scholars are not required to be present at the
defense. Departments will determine how to obtain meaningful and substantive
evaluations from external members in consultation with the Graduate School. A
written final examination, on subject matter not covered in the qualifying
examination, may also be required. This written examination is conducted by the
major department. These final examinations must be completed by the date listed
in the Graduate School calendar. After consultation with the major program, the
dean of the Graduate School may appoint, for participation in the final oral
examination, additional members of the faculty under whom the student has
worked. The doctoral committee alone shall decide on the merits of the
candidate's performance by a majority vote.

[5] Summer Session: Although many graduate ­level courses are offered during the
summer session, the University does not guarantee that any particular course
will be offered. The availability of individual faculty members to supervise
research or to participate in qualifying examinations and final examinations or
defenses during the summer session varies from year to year.

QUESTION:
What's the repeat rule for JUST 899?

ANSWER:
The same applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on an
approved leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: In order that UNH students may fully exercise their constitutional
right to vote in New Hampshire state and federal elections, no examinations will
be scheduled on the first Tuesday of November, and such should be designated in
the University calendars. Opportunities for makeup of other scheduled exercises
on those days should be provided where necessary. Faculty are requested to
cooperate to the fullest extent with students from communities scheduling
elections at other times.

[2] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[3] Registration: Continuous Registration Policy

[4] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

[5] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: When there are overlapping policies
and alleged violations, the Graduate School official may consult with the
Director of Community Standards and decide if the best path forward is to merge,
combine, or choose the most appropriate investigatory and hearing processes.
