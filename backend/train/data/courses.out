is to prepare talented, highly motivated UNH undergraduates for entrance to PhD
programs in all fields of study. The program aims to promote and nurture the
next generation of faculty, researchers, and scholars by providing academic and
social support services in the form of academic year internships and summer
research fellowships.

QUESTION:
What's the repeat rule for JUST 899?

ANSWER:
The same applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on an
approved leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: In order that UNH students may fully exercise their constitutional
right to vote in New Hampshire state and federal elections, no examinations will
be scheduled on the first Tuesday of November, and such should be designated in
the University calendars. Opportunities for makeup of other scheduled exercises
on those days should be provided where necessary. Faculty are requested to
cooperate to the fullest extent with students from communities scheduling
elections at other times.

[2] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[3] Registration: Continuous Registration Policy

[4] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

[5] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: When there are overlapping policies
and alleged violations, the Graduate School official may consult with the
Director of Community Standards and decide if the best path forward is to merge,
combine, or choose the most appropriate investigatory and hearing processes.
