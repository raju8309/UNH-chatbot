What should students do if they cannot enroll in the term for which admission was offered?\n\nAnswer: Admissions - Admission - Deferred Admission Applicants who cannot enroll in the term for which admission was offered may request to have their admission deferred for up to one year. Students who request a deferral, and who are not currently active in another degree program, are responsible for dropping any courses they may be currently enrolled in at the time they request the deferral. Such requests must be in writing and will be considered only once. Because enrollments are limited and competition for admission may vary from year to year, such requests may not be granted. Applicants who have received approved deferment of their admission cannot register for graduate coursework at the University during the period of deferment."}
