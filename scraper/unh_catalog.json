These investigations are mandated by University policy requiring a pre-employment background review for all appointees who commence their duties after July 1, 2008. A standard background review consists of a criminal history review, sex and violent offender registry review, social security trace and verification; and, if required by the nature of the appointment, a Department of Motor Vehicle record search. International students whose visas and/or authorization to work in the United States were obtained after the Patriot Act was implemented on October 12, 2001, are exempt from a criminal history check."

The Step 2 appeal will be heard by the Student Affairs Committee of the Graduate Council, unless the student requests that the Dean or the Dean’s designee hear the appeal.

          "The Department of Accounting and Finance within the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics offers two master’s programs: the Master of Science in Accounting and the Master of Science in Finance. Both master’s programs emphasize strong analytical and communication skills while fostering an awareness of ethical issues. The Paul College is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) .",
          "The Master of Science in Accounting provides students with range and depth in accounting while developing their ability to become innovative problem solvers in public accounting firms, large corporations, non-profits, and small businesses.  Students with undergraduate accounting degrees can complete the program in one year of full-time study or three years of part-time study.  Students without an undergraduate degree in accounting can apply but will need to take additional undergraduate foundation courses prior to beginning the graduate program. The program satisfies the 150-credit hour requirement of most Certified Public Accounting state licensing boards, including the state of New Hampshire.",
          "The Master of Science in Finance provides students with the analytical, programming, and problem-solving skills necessary to succeed in a complex financial environment. Upon graduation, these skills can be utilized in a variety of institutions, including investment banks, commercial banks, corporations, and asset management firms. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree but can come from any background. The program can be completed full-time in 10 months."

Following selection of the thesis advisor, the student and the advisor jointly agree on the members of the Guidance Committee, and communicate this recommendation to the Biochemistry Graduate Program Coordinator. The Doctoral Guidance Committee Nomination Form must be completed and submitted to the Graduate School by the end of the first year. The Guidance Committee consists of five faculty members: the advisor (as chairperson), two other members of the biochemistry graduate faculty, and up to two faculty members from other graduate programs. However, only three members of the Guidance Committee are required for the second-year exam. The Committee meets soon after selection of a thesis advisor to determine the student's curriculum. Courses required by the Guidance Committee must be taken for credit and completed with a passing grade (at least a B-minus­). Courses recommended by the committee may be audited or taken for credit, but in either case, the student is expected to be familiar with the subject matter of these courses. It is recommended that the Guidance Committee meet each semester thereafter to assess the student's academic and research progress.",
          "Doctoral Dissertation Committee: The Doctoral Committee is composed of the faculty advisor (as chairperson), two other faculty members in the graduate program in biochemistry, and up to two faculty members from other graduate programs. In most cases, the Guidance Committee constitutes the Doctoral Committee. The Doctoral Committee evaluates the dissertation and administers the final examination. The Doctoral Committee meets annually to assess the progress toward completion of the Ph.D. requirements.",
          "Qualifying Examination and PhD Candidacy:",
          "After completion of required coursework in the program and fulfilling other degree requirements, students seek the approval of the advisory committee to proceed to the qualifying exam, which should occur within 3-6 months of approval. Typically, the qualifying exam takes place in the third year - between the 4 th to 6 th semester of the candidate student’s academic program. The purposes of the qualifying exam are to i) assess the depth and breadth of knowledge in biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology, and in the student's specific research domain; ii) evaluate the student's capability of critical thinking and to develop a rigorous research proposal, and iii) assess the student's proficiency in scientific writing and communication, and to articulate and defend a research proposal.",
          "The qualifying exam consists of both a written and an oral section, both of which center on a student’s proposed dissertation topic . Alternatively, after consulting with the advisor and the advisory committee and receiving their approval, students may develop a research proposal on a topic that is derived from published research article(s). Students are expected to develop their research proposals under the oversight of their advisor and/or committee members, who should provide students guidance on topic selection and writing, with the aim of enhancing both scientific premise and written communications. It is recommended that the student and advisor meet at least three times to discuss and revise the proposal prior to submission to the committee. The student may submit the proposal to the committee only upon approval by their advisor. The advisor should ensure that the final version of the proposal is a product of original, creative thinking from the student.",
          "The written section of the qualifying exam is a research proposal, typically following the format of NIH NRSA predoctoral F31 fellowship (sample F31 proposal are available for reference (see https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/sample-applications )). Alternatively, for research that is more related to NSF themes or other funding agencies, it may follow the format of graduate research fellowship of NSF or other funding agencies.",
          "Specifically, the written section should include the following:",
          "The research proposal is submitted to the advisory committee for evaluation at least three weeks before the oral exam. Committee members may approve or reject the written proposal. If a committee member rejects the submitted proposal, they must provide a response to the student, with copy to the advisor and other committee members. The responses should articulate specific shortcomings and actionable steps that the student may take to rectify. The advisor is responsible for convening the committee to collectively assess the quality of the proposal. After the discussion, the committee will provide general comments and additional revision critiques specifying strengths and weaknesses of the proposal, as well as the necessary improvements that must be made by the student before submitting a revised version. Only after a majority of the members of the advisory committee has approved the written proposal, the student moves to the oral defense.",
          "Students are encouraged, in consultation with their advisor, to submit their research proposals to NIH to compete for a NRSA F31 predoctoral fellowship.",
          "The oral section is contingent upon the student having successfully completed the written section. The specific content of the oral exam is determined, in consultation with the advisory committee, primarily by the content of the written proposal. Students may give a brief update (~10 minutes) on their coursework and research progress at the beginning of the oral examination (~10 minutes). The presentation of the research proposal may last 30-40 minutes, followed by questions from the committee. Questions may arise from general knowledge in biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology, or specifically associated with the proposed project. Students are expected to defend the significance, premise, rationale, methodologies, and experimental plans outlined in their proposals. They are expected to present a feasible project utilizing available resources at UNH, the advisor’s laboratory, and collaborative supports. The oral exam typically lasts 90-120 minutes. Upon the completion of questions from the committee, the student will be asked to leave the defense room while the committee discusses the oral examination. The committee discussion should last no longer than 15 minutes, and consensus by the committee should be reached after a discussion. Afterwards, the student will be invited back into the room to hear the committee's verdict and their specific feedback on both the oral portion of their exam, and the qualifying exam in general.",
          "The grading of the qualifying exam includes Pass, Conditional Pass, or No Pass . Upon passing the qualifying examination, the student advances to PhD candidacy, officially declaring the intended dissertation topic. For students receiving a Conditional Pass, specific weaknesses identified by the committee are addressed through additional revision or research. Students who receive a No Pass have demonstrated insufficient scientific premise, mastery of lab skills or critical thinking. In this case, they have the option to retake the qualifying exam within 6 months. Students who cannot pass the qualifying exam after 2 nd trial are advised to pursue a master’s degree.",
          "Dissertation: The student is required to prepare a written doctoral dissertation for submission to the Doctoral Committee. The dissertation must represent significant and original research written in a clear, comprehensible style. A copy of the complete thesis must be made available to the committee at least two weeks before the date of the final examination. Publication of the dissertation by ProQuest is required.",
          "Final Defense: An oral examination of the doctoral dissertation consists of two parts: an oral presentation of the research that is open to the public, and an oral defense of the dissertation conducted by the doctoral committee. Final approval of the doctoral dissertation will be determined by a majority vote of the doctoral committee.",
          "Teaching Requirement: Teaching assignments in the laboratory, in lectures, or in an individual instruction format are an essential part of the graduate academic programs of the department and are designed to give graduate students practical teaching experience.

              "This option offers a home to students interested in basic organismal biology in all of its diverse aspects (physiology, neurobiology, behavior, cell biology, genetics, evolution, ecology, systematics, etc.), in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Modern biology employs approaches and tools ranging from molecular to ecological levels to gain a deep understanding of organismal functions and adaptations. Students in IOB approach their studies with a focus on organisms, and apply whatever tools are necessary to answer thematic and specific questions. Students interested in combining hands-on biological projects with research on teaching and learning biology at the post-secondary level should choose this option."

Some faculty at UNH use marine organisms, ranging from microbes to fish, invertebrates, and macroalgae to study physiology, molecular phylogeny, and species interactions; others focus on the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Faculty interests range from basic research on marine organisms and systems to applied areas such as aquaculture and fisheries; many combine the two."

After the discussion, the committee will provide general comments and additional revision critiques specifying strengths and weaknesses of the proposal, as well as any necessary improvements that must be made by the student before proceeding with the research. After a majority of the members of the advisory committee has approved the written proposal, the student moves to complete the study and undertake the oral defense.",

              "The oral section of the qualifying examination is contingent upon successful completion of the written section. The specific content of the oral exam is determined, in consultation with the Guidance Committee, primarily by the content of the written proposal. Students may give a brief update (~10 minutes) on their coursework and research progress at the beginning of the oral examination. The presentation of the research proposal may last 30-40 minutes, followed by questions from the committee. Questions may focus on general knowledge in neuroscience and behavior or focus on the proposed project. Students are expected to defend the significance, premise, rationale, methodologies, and experimental plans outlined in their proposal. The oral exam typically lasts 90-120 minutes. Upon the completion of questions from the committee, the student will be asked to leave the room while the Committee discusses the oral examination; the discussion should last no longer than 15 minutes, and result in consensus by the Committee. The student will then be invited back into the room to hear the Committee's decision and their specific feedback on both the oral portion of their exam and the qualifying exam in general.",
              "The qualifying exam may be awarded a grade of Pass, Conditional Pass, or No Pass. Upon passing the qualifying examination, the student advances to PhD candidacy, officially declaring the intended dissertation topic and appointing their Dissertation Committee. For students receiving a Conditional Pass, specific weaknesses identified by the committee must be addressed through additional coursework, revision, or research. Students who receive a No Pass, indicating insufficient mastery of scientific premise, lab skills, or critical thinking, have the option to retake the qualifying exam within 6 months. Students who cannot pass the qualifying exam after a second attempt are advised to pursue a Master’s degree, in which case they will need to formally change programs to the NSB M.S."

Externship sites may require a physical, including a tuberculin test; proof of immunizations such as poliomyelitis, rubella and hepatitis; health insurance; and drug/urine testing. In addition, students are responsible for meeting the criminal record clearances established by the practicum site. Failure to pass required medical and other clearance checks could render a student ineligible for a practicum assignment and thus unable to complete program requirements."

This foundational knowledge is the equivalent to the completion of: two terms mathematics, which includes both differential and integral calculus (one of these two terms could be statistics); two terms lab-based general chemistry; and two terms of a combination of biology and/or physics. Typical applicants have undergraduate (or equivalent) degrees in Earth sciences, environmental sciences, chemistry, physics, mathematics, data science, engineering, the biological sciences, or related fields. We also encourage inquiries from those who have earned an undergraduate degree in a different major with appropriate coursework in foundational subjects. Students still working to strengthen a particular component of their foundational coursework may be admitted provided they are prepared to complete courses, without graduate credit, as needed. The program of study a student wishes to follow, together with the research topic and the student's undergraduate major, determines any additional necessary coursework, which will be recommended during the admission process. Applicants are strongly encouraged to meet with their potential advisor(s) and/or the graduate program coordinator prior to submission of their application with any questions on admissions criteria and the degree program."

Organized to reflect the changing profession of literary study--its history, its methodologies, and its production of new knowledge--the program includes the study of literature in cultural and historical contexts, the study of representations of identity, comparative approaches to literature, theoretical perspectives, gender studies, and cultural studies. The program offers you both broad-based and specialized courses on a variety of literary topics, and students may supplement their course of literary study with graduate offerings in related subjects and departments, including courses in composition, creative writing, languages and linguistics, history, and sociology, among others."

The small 10-person workshop, intense conferencing with multiple award-winning faculty such as Ann Joslin Williams and Tom Paine, craft seminars that range from \"Joyce and Chekhov\" to Novellas and Contemporary Short Story Collections\", special topics classes on \"American Short Fiction by Women\" and \"Sentence Experiments in Literary Fiction\", an esteemed reading series that brings authors such as Dan Chaon and Elissa Schappell to class and campus, our nationally known literary magazine Barnstorm: all of this is here simply to advance your fiction. Maybe it is because we are in the Granite State, but what is notable in our program is not just how hard students work on their own fiction, but how much effort goes into their response to the work of their peers. Writers here care deeply about each other as people, and the production of honest work that captures life on the page."

Our focus, however, is not on labels but on nurturing your talent and developing your skills with the goal of helping you craft rich, compelling and publishable essays, stories and books. In short, we toil together to make facts dance. In our workshops and seminars we ask our students to read broadly and push themselves beyond their comfort zone, to experiment and exercise an array of literary muscles, to employ the imagery of a poet, the drama of a novelist and the content drive of a journalist. Our classes are small (average size is ten) and students meet frequently with instructors in individual conferences. As practical as the state of New Hampshire, our program emphasizes not only the art of writing narrative nonfiction, but also how to sell it. In one course students will learn how to write a book proposal and in others how to pitch travel stories and personal essays. The UNH nonfiction faculty is diverse in its expertise but united in its passion for reading and writing the literature of fact, and for sharing that passion."

We believe in grounding our students in the widest possible range of poetic technique and approach—with seminars offered in areas such as translation, 20th-century poetic movements, and ecstatic poetry—and no preconceived notions as to how anyone should write (other than well!). The poetic tradition of New England—one of the richest and most expansive in the world—serves as a backdrop for all our efforts. This is an area teeming with great poets, with numerous weekly opportunities for students to attend readings and lectures in the art."

Our courses cover a wide range of times, places, and subjects, with a particular strength in cultural history, women's history, the history of religion, Atlantic history, and African American history. In addition, M.A. students can focus on Museum Studies.",

          "The department usually requires evidence of substantial preparation in history at the undergraduate level, together with some preparation in other areas of humanities and social sciences.",
          "Applicants for admission to any graduate program in history should have a minimum of a B average in history, allied humanities, and social sciences. In addition, applicants must submit current scores (within five years) from the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The department assesses the student's entire application, including letters of recommendation and writing sample, in making its decision on admission. Deficiencies in an undergraduate program may be rectified by coursework as a special student, but such coursework cannot be used to satisfy requirements for an advanced degree. The department also recommends that a beginning graduate student have some training in a foreign language. Students in seminar or reading courses in other than American history may be required to have a reading knowledge of at least one foreign language appropriate to the particular course. Applicants should include with their applications a personal statement indicating their reason for undertaking graduate study at the University of New Hampshire. Normally, an entering student intending to be a candidate for the doctorate will complete an M.A. program as a prerequisite. However, students with the M.A. from another institution, or with exceptionally strong preparation at the undergraduate level, can begin the doctoral program immediately. In addition, a student in residence can, with the consent of the department, omit the M.A. and proceed directly toward the Ph.D."

          "Applied mathematics is the study of mathematical and computational methods for solving problems in science and engineering. Over the last several decades, the tools of applied mathematics have dramatically expanded the boundaries of scientific inquiry. It is becoming increasingly important to exploit the full power of mathematical and computational analysis to address the grand challenge problems facing society in areas including energy, climate, environmental sustainability, materials, finance and economics, biophysics and healthcare, and beyond.",
          "The Integrated Applied Mathematics (IAM) Program at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is a unique inter-departmental graduate program designed to facilitate interdisciplinary research by preparing highly motivated and capable students to become experts in mathematical and computational problem solving. The IAM Program draws its faculty from the nine departments within the UNH College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS), the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM), and the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA), and thus is inherently interdisciplinary. The Program gives students the opportunity to explore the frontier where the sciences meet cutting-edge mathematical analysis and high-performance computing. Current areas of mathematical and scientific focus include (but are not limited to): applied nonlinear (asymptotic, variational) analysis of ODEs and PDEs; high-dimensional dynamical systems and bifurcation theory; numerical algorithms for PDEs; machine learning and optimization theory; fluid dynamics; biophysics; materials and solid mechanics; space and plasma physics; and mathematical geo- and environmental science. Graduates of the program acquire the skills and training needed to enter numerous professions, including careers in research, education, and industry.",
          "Curriculum",
          "The IAM Program offers a unique curriculum emphasizing advanced applied mathematical methods and high-performance computing. A Ph.D. candidate in IAM is expected to develop expertise in both applied and computational mathematics as well as one area of specialization (e.g., fluid dynamics, plasma physics and space physics, geoscience, dynamical systems, biophysics, etc.).",
          "Facilities",
          "UNH hosts a state-of-the-art CRAY CS500 supercomputer with over 3000 compute cores and over 12 terabytes of memory. This supercomputer supports multiple projects involving IAM students and faculty.",
          "Admission and Financial Support",
          "Graduate students are admitted to the IAM program with a variety of backgrounds. The expectation is that a student entering the program will have a B.S. or M.S. degree in a technical field such as a mathematics, science, or an engineering discipline. Students with a M.S. degree in a technical field are particularly well suited for admission to the IAM Program. Students have been supported through Teaching Assistantships, CEPS Fellowships, and Research Assistantships funded by federal grants."

The specific format and outline of the written examination will be determined by the guidance committee. Once complete, the written qualifying examination will be submitted to, and assessed by, the guidance committee on a pass/fail basis.",

A nomination form must be sent to the graduate school to officially appoint the committee membership. The Guidance Committee consists of 3-5 members and is responsible for approving the proposal and oversees the qualifying examination. Once the student has advanced to candidacy, the Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formed. The Dissertation Committee is responsible for administering the dissertation exam.",

Students with an M.S. degree in oceanography or related field in physical science from UNH or another university should first demonstrate (through accredited transcript or the qualifying examination) acceptable mastery in the basic core areas. Those deficient in any discipline will be required to complete the respective course.",

Please see below for a list of courses that meet these specifications (other courses may qualify and should be approved by the FGC).  Additional credit hours are determined by the FGC (typically 15 credit hours). Foreign language requirement is determined by the FGC. Students must complete a Coursework Approval Form, which summarizes all courses to be taken, and obtain signatures from their adviser, committee members, and the OCE program coordinator once the coursework is completed.",

          "The Carsey School of Public Policy’s public service graduate degrees offer a unique combination of academic rigor and real-life expertise to prepare you for a career with impact. Our Master in Public Policy (MPP) offers you the tools you need to make a difference and create change in the challenging environment of 21st-century policymaking. You'll learn how to develop transformative, sustainable approaches to societal problems through research and analysis, and how to strategically communicate those ideas to bring them to fruition. In addition to equipping you to serve in a variety of public policy jobs, our MPP program will provide you with the skills to address the pressing issues that matter to you -- locally, nationally, and globally.",
          "You can also broaden your expertise by enrolling in the Carsey School's MPP/JD Dual Degree program which combines the Master in Public Policy program with a Juris Doctor of Law (MPP/JD) program offered by UNH's Franklin Pierce School of Law. This combined dual degree confers two degrees (an MPP degree and a JD degree) while shortening the time by one year to complete both degrees if pursued separately."

In some cases, earning academic credit from a policy internship may not be possible including a UNH Franklin Pierce Law School Legal Residency; however, in such cases the experience still fulfills the MPP Internship requirement ( PPOL 998A ). If the Internship is not taken for credit ( PPOL 998A ), students are required to take an additional MPP-Approved elective course. It is highly recommended that students consult with their MPP Graduate Academic Advisor to determine the best path for the student.",

This 12-credit hour Graduate Certificate program will allow you to take graduate-level courses at a leading public university while also giving you the option to apply credits toward a graduate degree program. Additionally, students will benefit from working with staff and faculty associated with the Institute on Disability (IOD) and the NH/ME-LEND program which focuses on developing educational excellence related to: a) current knowledge regarding neurodevelopmental disabilities, b) interdisciplinary practice, and c) strategies for effective leadership."

This committee assists the student in outlining a program and may specify individual coursework requirements in addition to those required by the area of specialization. The committee also conducts an annual in-depth review of each student's progress and, following substantial completion of a student's coursework, administers the qualifying examination. This committee is also responsible for administering the language examination and/or research-­tool proficiency requirements. Coursework and language requirements should normally be completed by the end of the second year of full­-time graduate study and must be completed before the student can be advanced to candidacy. Typically, at least 13 courses beyond the Bachelor of Science degree are required.",
          "Upon the successful completion of the qualifying examination and other proficiency requirements, the student is advanced to candidacy and, upon the recommendation of the student's area coordinator, a doctoral committee is appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. The doctoral committee conducts an annual review of the student's progress, supervises, and approves the doctoral dissertation, and administers the final dissertation defense.",
          "To obtain a Ph.D. degree, a student must meet all of the general requirements as stated under academic regulations and degree requirements of the Graduate School. Students are normally expected to take coursework equivalent to two full-time academic years beyond the baccalaureate and to complete a dissertation on original technical research that will require at least one additional year of full­-time study."
